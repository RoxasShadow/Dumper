Dumper
======

A dumper to download whole galleries from the more popular boards (aka, those I care).
It's fully modular, so you can add a website just adding its module in lib/dumper/profiles.
I own these profiles for a long time, so I don't know if they still work.
Also, it's all written to just work, so don't read them for a long time. They can be radioactive.


`dumper -l # list profiles`

`dumper -h # get help`

`dumper -u "http://boards.4chan.org/wg/res/5280736" -p "E:\\vessel" # dumping around the world ♪`

`dumper -u "http://www.mi9.com/wallpapers/cool-design-wallpapers_4846/" -o 2 -g 3 -p "E:\\vessel" # dump the pages 2 and 3`
